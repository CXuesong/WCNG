If you have any bug reports, suggestions, or feature requests, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/CXuesong/WCNG/issues) for this repository by simply clicking on "new issue" and writing what you want to say. Perhaps I'll improve this generator in the future, if I have enough time and energy.

**Why Brightheart?** Because not long before I started to write this, I was working on [Cloudtail](https://github.com/CXuesong/Cedarsong/tree/master/Cloudtail) XD

_Warriors_ is a cat-based fiction series written by Erin Hunter. This website application is intended to generate well-formed names for the characters (namely, cats).
